<h1>My attempts at a game</h1>
<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> recently had a Game maker bundle (it has ended now). So I was able to pick up a license for Game Maker:Studio Pro and some add ins for dirt cheap. This is my attempt at game building, and exporting to HTML5

<h2>Ghost Beta</h2>

The basic idea of the game is that you want to run away from ghosts. They cannot actually hurt you- but they scare you and raise your heart rate. If it goes too high, then you die!

This is what I got together in one day. Got some sprites built and a simple room. You move the player around using the arrow keys. The ghosts move and are animated. You cannot walk thru the tombstones. I did impliment a heart rate tracker with a simple equation where heart rate is based on distance to closest ghost and how many total ghosts are around. It worked in windows but doesnt seem to display in HTML5

<h3><a href="ghostbeta_Build2/index.html"> Day 2 Build</a></h3>
A bit more work. Not a great build.

<h3><a href="ghostbeta_Build3/index.html"> Day 3 Build</a></h3>
Added the ability to move to different rooms when off screen. Also a ghost counter and you die when heart rate too high (restarts the game).
